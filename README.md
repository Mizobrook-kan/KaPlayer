# KaPlayer

A music player aims to resolve some legacies of other players. Currently, It just provided basic functionality and css style refers to [repo vanillawebprojects](https://github.com/bradtraversy/vanillawebprojects/tree/master/music-player). I also want to implement extra features, such as frequency bar.
