# KaPlayer

A repo archives some experimental code on music player in browser. It aimes to explore audio API with some DSP filter effects hoisted on branch master. The player is implemented with a fancy style and being provided a spectrum as well as low-pass filter, high-pass filter and so on.

I don't maintain it anymore, since increasing fftSize would add more frequency bar and it results in a little free space in canvas, so I can't support a fine control over audio effects.
